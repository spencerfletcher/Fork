# Fork — Project AGENTS.md

## Project Overview

Full-stack recipe platform with git-style version control for recipes. Stack: SvelteKit + TypeScript frontend, PostgreSQL backend. Live at recipes.spencerfletcher.com.

## Architecture

- SvelteKit handles routing, SSR, and API endpoints
- Version control model is central — understand the branching/diffing logic before touching it
- PostgreSQL schema reflects the versioning model: treat migrations carefully

## Database

- Drizzle is the ORM: write queries with it, and keep `src/lib/server/db/schema.ts` as the typed source of truth for every table
- Schema changes edit `schema.ts` and add a hand-written SQL migration in `supabase/migrations/` in the same commit (`supabase migration new <name>`)
- Never use `drizzle-kit push`: it changes a database with no migration file, and `drizzle.config.ts` loads `.env.local` so it can hit the wrong database. `drizzle-kit generate` is unused until the migration chain moves to Drizzle (roadmap M10)
- Never modify the schema without a migration file
- Migrations are one-way — no rollback scripts means you need to get it right
- Version history is append-only by design — don't add any logic that mutates past versions
- Pre-production: no backward compatibility with stored data. When a JSONB shape changes, change the type, update the seed, reseed. No legacy types, no backfill or normalize helpers, no sanitising for data nothing writes any more
- Store only what cannot be derived. Position in a list is its number; do not add a stored index field
- Test schema changes locally against a copy of prod data structure before shipping

## Frontend

- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`
- Naming: an ingredient's number is `quantity` (never `amount`, which is reserved for quoting external APIs such as Spoonacular's `sourceAmount`)
- Status-like values are string literal unions, not enums. When a list must exist at runtime, declare it `as const` and derive the type from it
- Svelte stores for shared state, props for component-local state
- Keep components small and single-purpose
- Accessibility matters: interactive elements need keyboard support and ARIA where appropriate

## API / Endpoints

- Validate all inputs server-side — don't trust client data
- Return consistent error shapes: `{ error: string, code: string }`
- Auth-gated endpoints need explicit permission checks — don't rely on route structure alone

## Testing

- Every new feature must have tests before it's marked done — no exceptions
- Order: server logic tests first (Vitest, Node env), then component tests, then e2e
- Unit test files live next to the source file: `Foo.svelte` → `Foo.svelte.test.ts`, `page.server.ts` → `page.server.test.ts`
- Use `@testing-library/svelte` for component tests; match existing `makeX()` helper patterns
- Use `vi.hoisted()` for any mock function used inside `vi.mock()` factory
- Build recipe content fixtures with the helpers in `src/lib/recipes/fixtures.ts`, never with hand-written object literals, so a shape change touches one file
- When a stored type changes shape, do the type and every reader as one vertical slice so `svelte-check` is green at the end of the task; server-first ordering is for new features
- Run `pnpm test:unit` before committing; don't commit with failing unit tests

## Deployment

- This is a live site — flag anything that would cause downtime or data loss
- Test SSR behavior locally before pushing — hydration bugs are hard to catch after deploy
